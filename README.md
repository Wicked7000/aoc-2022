# AoC 2022 - In Kotlin!

This is a slightly modified version of the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.

The main differences being in how files are organised and called, allowing for a single main file to run where you specify the day you'd like to execute. As I get further into AoC 2022 I'll likely start adding wrappers around the `Day` class for things like calculating the total runtime as that starts to get more interesting towards the end of AoC where problems become more complex.

Feel free to give suggestions on solutions you see here as I'm new to learning Kotlin and have likely missed out on some cool features!
